A significant proportion of these dispersing moths are egg-carrying females.\n\nRepresentative animations of simulation outputs are presented here for the latest dispersal years.\n\n**Please refer to the [Contact](contact.qmd) page for data requests.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## 2025\n\n::: {#dispersal-2025}\n:::\n\n## 2024\n\n::: {#dispersal-2024}\n:::\n\n## 2023\n\n::: {#dispersal-2023}\n:::\n\n## 2022\n\n::: {#dispersal-2022}\n:::\n",
