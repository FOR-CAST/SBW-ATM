This is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website developed using the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage R package dependencies.

The site is automatically built using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Getting started

You will need `git`, `R`, `RStudio`, and Quarto installed.

1.  [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository from GitHub;
2.  Open the project in the RStudio IDE;
3.  You will be prompted to install the required R package dependencies -- use `renv::restore()` to install the necessary package versions;
4. Add the Quarto [`fontawesome`](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) extension:

    ```bash
    quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome
    ```

5.  See <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#workflow> for working with Quarto;

### File and directory structure

#### Project configuration files

-   The Rstudio project file `SBW-ATM.Rproj` contains project configuration information;
-   The R package versions required to work with the project are recorded in `renv.lock` and installed to a subdirectory of `renv/`;

#### Website configuration files

-   Overall website layout, navigation, and theme, are defined in `_quarto.yml`;
-   See <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#website-theme> for configuring the website's theme;
-   See <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html> for configuring website layout and navigation;

#### Website content

-   Images and logos are located in `images/`;
-   Animated images depicting simulation runs of the model are located in `outputs/` and organized by year;
-   Pages are rendered using the `.qmd` files (*NOTE:* this `README.qmd` file and it's rendered `REAADME.md` are not built as part of the site);
-   Bibliographic references are used by some pages, and may be referenced in several `.bib` files:
    -   `publications.bib` lists all of the publications *using* the SBW-ATM tool;
    -   `references.bib` lists all of the publications *used by* the SBW-ATM tool; (see <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html> for more information about using citations)

#### Built website files

-   The built (generated) website files are in `docs/`;
-   You can preview your changes after rendering the site by opening `docs/index.html` in your web browser;

## Updating the site

After making any updates, render the website locally to preview your updates.
If all looks good, commit your changes to the source files, and push to GitHub.

:::{.callout-warning}
Do not commit any of the rendered website files in `docs/` (they are already `.gitignore`d).
These files will be automatically built and the website rendered using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

:::{.callout-tip}
To avoid rebuilding the site after making minor changes, use [`[skip ci]`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs) in the commit message.
