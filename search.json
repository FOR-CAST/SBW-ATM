    "text": "Eastern North America is in the midst of a rising epidemic of spruce budworm (SBW). The SBW transport model (ATM) is an individual-based (or agent-based) modeling framework designed to simulate and understand the long-distance dispersal of adult SBW moths. Hourly simulations of insect phenology, moth emergence, takeoff, flight, and landing allow us to report on daily flight trajectories taken by individual moths.\n\n Historically, large numbers of SBW moths have been observed to disperse over vast areas, covering distances up to 600 km (373 miles) from their origin. Moths tend to move large distances in concentrated streams - “atmospheric rivers” - because of atmospheric transport. Such mass exodus flights, often involving billions of moths, typically occur in favorable weather conditions, starting around sunset and continuing for several hours with wind-driven transport. A significant proportion of these dispersing moths are egg-carrying females, which are able to lay the foundation for an expanding outbreak. This model is crucial for forecasting future larval defoliation in new areas, where moth immigration can enable populations to overcome local limitations and initiate or expand outbreaks, thereby supporting forest management decisions."

    "text": "Initially designed as an experimental tool in 2010, the spruce budworm ATM has been operationalized as a near real-time forecasting and backcasting tool.\nThe spruce budworm ATM was initiated by the United States Forest Service Research Branch in 2003 by Gary Achtemeier, after consultations with Brian Sturtevant. The early ATM was grounded in Gary’s foundational work on particle dispersal through the 1970s-2000s (Scott and Achtemeier 1987; Achtemeier 1998, 2002).\nFollowing a materials transfer in 2013, the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) and University of Wisconsin (UW) assumed lead roles in model development, with CFS implementing an operationalized version of the model in BioSIM, and UW implementing a research and development version in Python. The operational version simulates thousands of flight tracks and is useful as a strategic policy and planning tool. The experimental version simulates millions of flight tracks and is designed as a tactical pest management planning tool. Both are “operational” from an informatic perspectives.",

    "text": "The spruce budworm (SBW) atmospheric transport model is an individual-based (or agent-based) modeling framework designed to simulate and understand the long-distance dispersal of adult SBW moths (Choristoneura fumiferana). This model is crucial for forecasting future larval defoliation in new areas, where moth immigration can enable populations to overcome local limitations and initiate or expand outbreaks, thereby supporting forest management decisions. Historically, large numbers of SBW moths have been observed to disperse over vast areas, covering distances up to 600 km (373 miles) from their origin. Such mass exodus flights, often involving billions of moths, typically occur in favorable weather conditions, starting around sunset and continuing for several hours with wind-driven transport. A significant proportion of these dispersing moths are egg-carrying females.\nRepresentative animations of simulation outputs are presented here for the latest dispersal years.\nPlease refer to the Contact page for data requests.",
